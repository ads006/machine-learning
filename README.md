Scenario: You work at a multinational bank that is aiming to increase it's market share in Europe. Recently, it has been noticed that the number of customers using the banking services has declined, and the bank is worried that existing customers have stopped using them as their main bank.
As a data scientist, you are tasked with finding out the reasons behind customer churn (when a customer stops using them as the main bank) and to predict customer churn.
The marketing team, in particular, is interested in your findings and want to better understand existing customer behavior and possibly predict customer churn. Your results will help the marketing team to use their budget wisely to target potential churners. To achieve this objective, in this exercise, you will import the banking data (Churn_Modelling.csv) provided by the bank and do some machine learning to solve their problem.
